# Interative Neuron Models
In this repository, you can find a variety of computational neuron models,
ranging from complex models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model over to simple
model like a leaky integrate-and-fire model; written in Python 3.  
Each of those is represented via a GUI, coded in **tkinter**, allowing the
user to manipulate the external current as well as model specific key values.

---

## Required Python Packages
- ```Numpy```
- ```Matplotlib```
- ```Scipy```
- ```tkinter```

---

## Execution
Simply clone this repository, be sure to have all the required packages
installed and execute ```Model_Simulator.py```, which opens a menu of different
models to choose from.  
After one is chosen, an interactive ```matplotlib``` window will open.
